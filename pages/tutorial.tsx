        <p>
          The Raspberry Pi mini computer was born as an educational machine and
          as the first tool to put your knowledge into practice. It has now
          evolved and thanks to its modest power it can be used in many
          different projects. One of the most popular projects the Raspberry Pi
          is used for is turning it into a home media center. <br></br> Plex is
          a well-known streaming media server that allows you to organize
          Movies, Music, Pictures and Videos and stream them to all your devices
          at any time and from anywhere. <br></br> Letâ€™s see now how to install
          Plex Media Server on Raspberry Pi.

        <ul className='list-disc'>
          <li>
            Raspberry with Raspbian installed. Or else Ubuntu. If you do not
            know how to proceed with the installation click&nbsp;

            , I recommend an installation without a graphical interface in order
            to make everything lighter. Plex doesn&rsquo;t need a GUI as it has
            its own.
          </li>

            I recommend using external storage for media files. A HDD, SSD, or
            at most a USB stick will do just fine.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The safest and easiest way to install Plex Media Server on Raspberry
          Pi is to use the official repository.
          <br />
          Installation shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Log into the Raspberry via SSH or connect it to a monitor and follow
          the steps below.
          <br />
          Let&rsquo;s start with updating our Raspberry.
